Help My Manager
===========

Little things that help managers.

# Utilities

## Utility #1: /TeamTrack

Take the data that your team provides and you're good to go.

### Goal of this app

To stop using email for sending out the daily working email. As a worker, update your work.js file and update your model according.

Make a pull request so that your manager can merge changes. It'll stay in a repo. How developery is that? Also, no emails. (Blech).


# How to build

1. fork it.
2. `git clone https://github.com/<your user name>/HelpMyManager.git` or `git@github.com:<your user name>/HelpMyManager.git`
    example: `git clone https://github.com/IAmAnubhavSaini/HelpMyManager.git` or `git clone git@github.com:IAmAnubhavSaini/HelpMyManager.git`
3. `npm install`
4. `grunt test`
5. `grunt build`
6. `npm test`
7. visit localhost:8000 (most probably)

OR

If you looking to save time typing:

`git clone https://github.com/IAmAnubhavSaini/HelpMyManager.git && npm install && grunt test && grunt build && npm test`

As always, in case something break, read error message and figure out.

If cannot figure out soon enough, report an issue on GitHub issues with error log.

# Contributing guide


Whatever, if you can run tests and add something to the app (however crazy), do it.

Put stuff in your own branch and do stuff there. Please do not push to `master` branch.


# Note:

This app is still in progress. So, design of data, design of app itself might change quite frequently. And that is a good thing. We are just starting out. We have no upper limit on how to help managers, so expect anything.
